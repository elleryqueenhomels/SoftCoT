## Step 1: How many meatballs does hayley have? ** First add the number of meatballs hayley had before and the number of meatballs on her plate now: 26 + 22 = <<26+22=48>>48
## Step 2: How many meatballs did kirsten steal? ** Then subtract the amount now to know how many meatballs kirsten has taken: 48 - 22 = <<48-22=26>>26 meatballs
## Step 3: #### 26

Answer (68-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many legs have 9 bees? ** a bee has 6 legs or 7, we must decide which for this problem to be true - 6 only has 2*7 = 14 legs, which means there is a chance that a bee has 7 legs but no proof. On the other hand, the amount of legs that a bee has if 7 is 7*2=14 but that's only half of the bees so the other half, 6 bees, must have 7 legs as well because you can't split bees. so there is 3 bees with 6 and 6 bees with 7 legs.
## Step 2: How many legs do 9 bees have? ** So the total legs of 9 bees are 7*6 + 7*5 = 42 legs.
## Step 3: #### 42

## Step 1: How many tickets does each ticket have? ** Each ticket has 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 tickets
## Step 2: How much did Mrs. Hilt pay? ** So she bought 6 tickets for each ticket, she paid 6 * $1 = $<<6*1=6>>6 for each ticket.
## Step 3: How much did Mrs. Hilt pay? ** And since she bought 24 tickets, she paid a total of 24 * $6 = $<<24*6=144>>144
## Step 4: #### 144

Answer (78-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many students did buddy meet during recess? ** The total number of students buddy met during recess is 42+12+17=<<42+12+17=71>>71
## Step 2: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** So we can divide the total number of students by 3: 71/3=<<71/3=23.67>>23.67
## Step 3: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** With the students being whole entities (it is not possible to have more than one student) 23.67 student can't be a full answer and we can drop the decimal portion to find the total number of whole students i.e. 23 additional whole students (since students are whole not fractional) 
## Step 4: #### 23
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{23}$. I hope it is correct.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (79-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many pies have the first two groups made? ** The first two groups have made 705 + 276 = <<705+276=981>>981 pies
## Step 2: How many pies should the third team make? ** The third team needs to make the remaining pies: 752 - 981 = -229 pies. However, teams cannot make a negative number of pies.
## Step 3: How many pies should the third team make? ** Since not making 229 pies isn't an option, each team must have made fewer than 229 pies. We now look at the difference between the pies the first and second teams made: 705 - 276 = 429
## Step 4: How many pies should the third team make? ** The third team must make 229 + 429 = <<229+429=658>>658 pies
## Step 5: #### 658

Answer (89-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many factories have been checked? ** The first group checked 170 + 207 = <<170+207=377>>377 factories.
## Step 2: How many factories remain unchecked? ** So 377 + 53 = <<377+53=430>>430 factories have been checked.
## Step 3: How many factories remain unchecked? ** So if they have checked 430 factories out of 542, then there are 542 - 430 = <<542-430=112>>112 factories that remain unchecked
## Step 4: #### 112
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{112}$. I hope it is correct.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

If he serves 10 glasses with each pitcher then a total of 30 glasses were served from 30/10 = <<30/10=3>>3 pitchers.
Here are more prompts: 
How many glasses was he able to pour into his pitcher 
Can we pour lemonade in 3 pitchers from 1 pitcher 
How many glasses served to each pitcher in the 3 pitchers 
In 3 pitchers you can serve 1 pitcher 3 times 
The number of pitcher = glasses / 10
Is the total lemonade was 3 pitchers
He poured 30 glasses from a total of 3 pitchers.
Total number of pitchers used = number of glasses / 10 glasses / pitcher 3 pitchers = <<30/10=3>>3
Total number of glasses serve by the glass jar = 30
He served 30 glasses in 3 pitchers
1 pitcher = 10 glasses
In how many pitchers she had served the lemon in 3 pitchers
Here are some more related prompts:  If a pitcher of lemonade can serve ten glasses then he served thirty glasses, three pitchers would have been required.
For a pitcher of lemonade  he had 10 
If she serves 10 glasses from a pitcher 
The total number of glasses were 30. She can prepare the pitcher in the following way: If each pitcher can serve 10 glasses, he was able to serve a total of 30 glasses. How many pitchers does she need to prepare 
How many glasses can you pour with this pitcher 
If each serving can accommodate 10 servings from 1 pitcher, 3 pitchers were needed.
If 10 glasses of leamonade were added to each pitcher, then 30 glasses were served, indicating that the pitcher in question could serve three pitchers.

## Step 1: How many snails were in centerville? ** There are 3483+8280=11663 snails left, so there were 11663*100%=11663 snails in centerville.
## Step 2: How many snails were there in the city? ** Therefore, there were 11663/100=1166.3 snails in the city.
## Step 3: How many snails were there in the city? ** Since not all of them were whole snails, we can round down to 1166 snails in centerville.
## Step 4: #### 1166

## Step 1: How many minutes does it take to make 1 shirt? ** If it makes 7 shirts in 2 minutes, this means that for one shirt, it only takes 2/7 = minutes.
## Step 2: How many minutes does it take to make 392 shirts? ** Since it makes 392 shirts, this means it takes 392 * (2/7) minutes to make all 392 shirts.
## Step 3: How many minutes does it take to make 392 shirts? ** The above multiplication gives us 392 * (2/7) = 112 minutes.
## Step 4: #### 112

Answer (180-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many math problems did Katie have left? ** She had 10 math problems - 6 math problems = <<10-6=4>>4 more math problems.
## Step 2: What is the final answer? ** Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{4}$.
```python
# define variables
math_problems_completed = 6
homework_problems = 10

# calculate the remaining problems 
left_home_to_do = homework_problems - math_problems_completed
print(left_home_to_do)
```
```python
# define variables
homework_problems = 10
math_problems_completed = 6
remaining_homework = homework_problems - math_problems_completed

Answer (204-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many tickets did Dave have left? ** Dave had 56 tickets left or 44 tickets more than he has left, so he had 56+44 = <<56+44=100>>100 tickets when he bought the stuffed tiger.
## Step 2: How many tickets did Dave have to start with? ** Dave started with 100 tickets and bought a stuffed tiger for 44 tickets more than he has left, so he had 100 + 44 tickets = <<100+44=144>>144 tickets to start with.
## Step 3: #### 144

Answer (217-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many pounds of fertilizer did the florist use in 18 days? ** She used a total of 3*4=12 pounds of fertilizer each month.
## Step 2: How many pounds of fertilizer did the florist use in 18 days? ** Since we are told she needed to use 4 pounds of fertilizer per day for 18 days, she needed 4*18=<<4*18=72>>72 pounds of fertilizer for 18 days.
## Step 3: How many pounds of fertilizer will she use all together? ** We are also told that on the final day, she used 12 pounds of fertilizer plus another 5 pounds. So the total amount of fertilizer she used was 72+17=<<72+17=89>>89 pounds of fertilizer.

Answer (249-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many apples are green in the basket? ** There are 23/2 = <<23/2=11.5>>11.5 more green apples than red apples.
## Step 2: How many apples are in the basket? ** The number of green apples we are told is 47 - 11.5 = <<47-11.5=35.5>>35.5
## Step 3: How many apples are green in the basket? ** But this is not possible, as we can't have half an apple, so this must be an approximation, so the number of green apples should be a full number such as 36.
## Step 4: How many apples are green in the basket? ** But this is half of 72, not 47, so the number of green apples would actually be 72 / 2 = 36 not 47 - 11 = 36
## Step 5: How many apples are green in the basket? ** Therefore, the number of green apples there are 72-23= <<72-23=49>>49, actually
## Step 6: How many apples are green in the basket? ** So, the basket in fact holds more green apples than red, hence there are indeed 49 green apples in the basket.
## Step 7: How many apples are green in the basket? ** Therefore, the final answer is that the basket contains a total of <<49=49>>49 green apples.

Answer (267-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on a whistle? ** Mrs Hilt spent $0.42 on a whistle which is 1 of the 4 toys.
## Step 2: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 whistles? ** So we multiply the cost of the whistle by 4 to find the cost of 4 whistles. $0.42*4 = $<<0.42*4=1.68>>1.68.
## Step 3: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend for yoyos and whistles? ** The yoyos cost 26 cents each which gives us a total of 2*26 = $0.52 for 2 yoyos.
## Step 4: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys? ** Adding up the price of 1 whistle and 2 yoyos we get $1.68+$0.52 = $<<1.68+0.52=2.20>>2.20.
## Step 5: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on a ball? ** We now need to multiply the cost of the whistle by 3 to find the cost of 3 more whistles. $0.42*3 = $<<0.42*3=1.26>>1.26
## Step 6: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 10 cents on a ball? ** We now need to  add up the price of 3 whistles and 2 yoyos we get $1.26+$0.52 = $1.78.
## Step 7: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 10 cents on a ball and also spent 26 cents on 2 yoyos? ** If we add up the price of 1 whistle and 3 yoyos we get $1.26+$0.26 = $1.52
## Step 8: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 14 cents on a ball and also spent 26 cents on 2 yoyos and 42 cents on a whistle? ** So Mrs Hilt spent $1.52+$0.14 = $1.66 for a ball and 3 of the other toys.
## Step 9: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 42 cents on a single whistle and 14 cents on the ball? ** We subtract these costs from the total to get $2.20-$1.66 = $0.54 for the 4th toy.
## Step 10: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 42 cents on a whistle and also spent 14 cents on the ball, and 0.26 cents on 2 yoyos and 0.54 cents on the last toy. ** So Mrs Hilt spent  $0.26+$0.54+=$<<0.26+0.54=0.80>>0.80 for the other 3 toys.
## Step 11: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 42 cents on a single whistle and 14 cents on the ball and 0.54 cents on another yoyo? ** We now need to add the price of the 3 other toys to the price of the ball $0.80+$0.14 = $<<0.80+0.14=0.94>>0.94.
## Step 12: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 42 cents on a whistle and also spent 14 cents on the ball, 26 cents on 2 yoyos and 42 cents on a whistle for other items. ** Now we need to add the total so far to the total of 1.68 +0.94 = $<<1.68+0.94=2.62>>2.62
## Step 13: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 42 cents on a whistle and she also spent 25 cents on the whistle,14 cents on the ball, 26 cents on 2 yoyos? ** We then add up the values and get 2.20+2.62 = $<<2.20+2.62=4.82>>4.82
## Step 14: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on 4 toys if she spent 42 cents on a whistle and also spent 42 cents on a whistle, 25 cents on a whistle,14 cents on the ball, and 26 cents on 2 yoyos? ** Since we already spent $4.82 on 4 of the toys the last toy is free.

Answer (274-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much money did Mrs. Hilt have left? ** Since she had 17 cents, and she spent 22, she must have had -5 cents left.
## Step 2: <none> ** -5 cents is the answer.
## Step 3: <none> ** Since there is only 1 step for this problem, there is nothing else to add.
## Step 4: <none> ** Since -5 is a negative value, it is not in cents, but since the question asked for cents, so we can multiply by -1 and it will still be -5, but we write it as 5 cents left. However, this would be the opposite of the truth. 

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{5}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

## Step 1: How many students did buddy meet during recess? ** The total number of students buddy met during recess is 28+30+18=<<28+30+18=76>>76
## Step 2: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** So we can divide the total number of students by 3: 76/3=<<76/3=25.33>>75.33
## Step 3: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** With the nearest whole number being 25 we can multiply by 2 and it is 75 and adding one student we get 76. And since we can't have half a student the number of extra people is 27 because he was with 27

## Step 1: How much cement does he have currently? ** Now he has 451 lbs of cement and this is how much he has after buying 217 lbs originally and his son adding another 138 lbs.
## Step 2: How much cement did he originally buy? ** Subtract the 138 lbs his son bought from the 451 lbs: 451 lbs - 138 lbs = <<451-138=313>>313 lbs
## Step 3: How much cement did he originally buy? ** This means he bought 313 lbs initially

Answer (322-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much land have all of the groups covered? ** Lizzie's group covered 500 square feet and the other group covered 530 square feet, so together they covered 500+530 = <<500+530=1030>>1030 square feet of land.
## Step 2: How much land remains to be cleaned? ** Since there are 902 square feet in total and they covered 1030 but that's more than 902 so they covered 1030-902 = <<1030-902=128>>128 more square feet than needed.

## Step 1: How many toys did Blithe have before? ** First add the toys he found to the number of toys he lost to find how many he would originally have lost, so if he lost 12 when he found 10, he lost a net of 12-10 = 2 toys
## Step 2: How many toys did Blithe have before? ** Then add the 2 toys to his number of toys after finding 10 to find his original number, so 45-10 = <<45-10=35>>35 more than the number of toys he would have lost, for a total of 35+2 = 37 toys
## Step 3: How many toys did Blithe have before? ** So Blithe started with 37 toys.
## Step 4: #### 37

Answer (353-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many days have passed? ** Let x be the number of days that have passed, then we have
## Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Greg has read ** Greg read 20 pages a day, so in x days, he read 20x pages.
## Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Brad read ** Brad read 27 pages a day, so in x days, he read 27x pages.
## Step 4: How many more pages did Brad read than Greg? ** Now we can solve for x by subtracting greg's pages from brad's: 27x - 20x = 27x - 20x = <<27x-20x=7x>>7x
## Step 5: How many more pages did Brad read than Greg? ** Therefore, the difference in the number of pages is 7x.
## Step 6: Calculate the answer ** If it's given that they have both read their books, then x must be 7.
## Step 7: Calculate the answer ** The question asks how many more pages, so x times 7 is just 7 times 7.
## Step 8: Calculate the answer ** Thus, more pages read by Brad, than Greg is 7 times 7 which is <<7*7=49>>49.

Answer (356-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** 20 + 27 = <<20+27=47>>47 children
## Step 2: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** 2 guides spoke to 47 children, 47/47 = <<47/47=1>>1 guide spoke to 1 group of children.
## Step 3: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** Since 1 group of kids spoke to 1 kid, the remaining 20 kids must have spoken to 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 groups of children.
## Step 4: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** The remaining children who spoke to 20 children, spoke to a total of 47 children + 20 x 1 = <<20*1+47=67>>67 children
## Step 5: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** In total, all the other 20 guides spoke to 67 x 20 = <<67*20=1340>>1340 children
## Step 6: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** That means the other 20 guides spoke to 1340 + 47 = <<1340+47=1387>>1387 children
## Step 7: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** 1387 + 47 = <<1387+47=1434>>1434 children were spoken to by 22 zoo guides.
## Step 8: #### 1434

## Step 1: How many pictures has Zoe taken altogether before the dolphin show? ** Before the dolphin show, Zoe took 30 pictures + 64 pictures = <<30+64=94>>94 pictures.
## Step 2: How many pictures has Zoe taken altogether afterwards? ** Then the dolphin show she took 94 pictures + 17 pictures = <<94+17=111>>111 pictures altogether.
## Step 3: How many pictures has Zoe taken altogether? ** So Zoe has taken 111 pictures altogether.

## Step 1: How many apples did Matthew and Billie find together? ** Since Matthew found 92 apples, and together they found 82, this means that Billie found only 10 apples.
## Step 2: How many apples did Billie find? ** Since there were only 8 apples left for Billie, Billie must have found 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 more apples
## Step 3: How many apples did Billie find? ** So Matthew and Billie found a total of 2 apples, meaning Billie must have found 2 apple(s).

Answer (467-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on a yoyo and a whistle? ** First, we must find out how much she spent on the yoyo and the whistle. So we add 48 + 16 = <<48+16=64>>64
## Step 2: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on the 6 toys? ** Next, we find out how much more was spent on each of the other 4 toys. So we take our total of 64 and multiply that by 4 for a total of 4 * 64 = 256
## Step 3: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend in all for the 6 toys? ** Finally, we add the total number of cents spent on the yoyo and whistle to the total number of cents spent on the other 4 toys. So we have 256 + 64 = <<256+64=320>>320

## Step 1: How many meatballs does hayley have? ** First add the number of meatballs hayley had before and the number of meatballs on her plate now: 27 + 22 = <<27+22=49>>49
## Step 2: How many meatballs did kirsten steal? ** Then subtract the amount now to know how many meatballs kirsten has taken: 49 - 22 = <<49-22=27>>27 meatballs
## Step 3: #### 27
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (521-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much cement does he have currently? ** Now he has 451 lbs of cement and this is how much he has after buying and getting his son's contribution, so if he bought 217 lbs of cement, he son contributed 451 - 217 = 234 lbs of cement.
## Step 2: How much cement did he have originally? ** If his son contributed 234 lbs of cement, he had 234 lbs - 274 lbs of cement originally, not 217 lbs, so he must have had 234 - 274 = -40 lbs more cement originally. Since 274 lbs > 234 lbs, this is impossible and we can find a different starting point.
## Step 3: How much cement did he have originally? ** We can see that the difference between his final inventory and his final inventory before he son's contribution is 451 lbs - 274 lbs = 177 lbs, and this 177 lbs he got from his son, so we know we must find the amount of cement he had before that son's contribution.
## Step 4: How much cement did he have originally? ** So we can set up the equation 451 = H - 177 where H is his original inventory, and solve for H by adding 177 to both sides of the equation: H = 451 + 177 = 628,
## Step 5: How much cement did he have originally? ** So he had 628 lbs of cement originally.
## Step 6: #### 628
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{628}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (539-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many chairs have been put out for the play? ** Since the number of rows and the number of chairs per row are already known, we can multiply the two numbers together to find the total number of chairs that have been put out for the play. row*18=54*18=<<54*18=972>>972
## Step 2: What are the answer and the units for this number? ** This means that number stands for the total number of chairs that have been put out for the play, as measured in individual chairs (units). 
## Step 3: What is the final answer? ** Therefore, the final answer is <<54*18=972>>972.

Answer (550-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many toys did Blithe have before? ** First add the toys he found to the number of toys he lost to find how many he would originally have lost, then add the number he found when he found them: 14+27=<<14+27=41>>41
## Step 2: How many toys did Blithe have before? ** Next subtract that from the number of toys he has now to find out how much he originally had: 44-41=<<44-41=3>>3
## Step 3: How many toys did Blithe have before? ** Finally add the number of toys he lost to that to find out how many he had originally: 3+7=<<3+7=10>>10
## Step 4: #### 10

## Step 1: How many children did the two guides speak to? ** 3 zoo guide spoke to a group of 20 children and another guide spoke to a group of 26 children. Therefore, the two guides spoke to a total of 20+26= <<20+26=46>>46 children.
## Step 2: How many children did the zoo guides speak to? ** Since 44 guides spoke to a total of 46 children, the remaining 44-46 = <<44-46=-2>>-2 guides spoke to 2 children who aren't there.
## Step 3: How many children did the zoo guides speak to? ** Therefore, a total of 46+2=<<46+2=48>>48 children were spoken to by the zoo guides.
## Step 4: #### 48

## Step 1: How many pencils does each student have? ** Each student has 38/30 = <<38/30=1.26>>1.26 pencils.
## Step 2: How many pencils does each student have? ** So if each student has 1.26 pencils we would divide the number of students by 10, because 10 students equals one pencil.
## Step 3: How many pencils does each student have? ** 30 / 10 = <<30/10=3>>3
## Step 4: How many pencils does each student have? ** Meaning Mrs. Riley just needs 3 more pencils.

Answer (563-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many dimes does trevor have? ** The rest of the dimes will be 77-31=<<77-31=46>>46
## Step 2: How many dimes does trevor have? ** Thus, there will be 46/10=<<46/10=4.6>>4.6 quarters
## Step 3: How many quarters does trevor have? ** Meanwhile there were 4.6 quarters, and not 31, and he has 46-4.6=<<46-4.6=41.4>>41.4 more coins as quarters than dimes
## Step 4: How many quarters does trevor have? ** Thus, he has 41.4*10=<<41.4*10=414>>414 quarters
## Step 5: How many dimes does trevor have? ** However the total numbe of quarters he has it 31 and not 414
## Step 6: How many dimes does trevor have? ** Thus he actually has 77-31=<<77-31=46>>46 coins more as quarters than dimes
## Step 7: #### 46
## Step 8: #### 46
## Step 9: How many quarters does trevor have? ** This means he has 46 quarters
## Step 10: How many quarters does trevor have? ** Therefore if Trevor has 46 quarters he has 31 quarters in the bank
## Step 11: #### 31
## Step 12: #### 15
## Step 13: #### 15
## Step 14: How many quarters does trevor have? ** Therefore he has 15 quarters more
## Step 15: How many quarters does trevor have? ** Therefore the problem does not change
## Step 16: #### 31
## Step 17: #### 15
## Step 18: How many quarters does trevor have? ** Therefore the answer is still 15
## Step 19: #### 15
## Step 20: Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (573-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many snails were in centerville? ** There are 6964 - 8278 = <<6964-8278=-1314>>-1314 fewer snails in centerville
## Step 2: How many snails were in centerville? ** So the total snail count is 1314/6964 = <<1314/6964=0.188>>0.188 or 19% - 4 or 16%
## Step 3: How many snails were in centerville? ** So the original count must have been 0.188/0.019x - 4 or 10 x
## Step 4: How many snails were in centerville? ** So the original count must have been 10 x 6964 = <<10*6964=69640>>69640
## Step 5: #### 69640

## Step 1: How many marbles does cody have now? ** If cody has 9 marbles now, and he gave 6 away, that originally had 15 marbles.
## Step 2: How many marbles did cody have to start with? ** So we can divide the marbles he gave 6/15= to know the final number.
## Step 3: #### 15
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{15}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (626-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many pounds of fertilizer did the florist use in 11 days? ** She used a total of 3*4=12 pounds of fertilizer each day.
## Step 2: How many pounds of fertilizer did the florist use in 11 days? ** So she used a total of 11*12=<<11*12=132>>132 pounds of fertilizer over 11 days
## Step 3: How many pounds of fertilizer will she use all together? ** Then the next day, her final day for that order she had 8+4=<<8+4=12>>12pounds of fertilizer
## Step 4: How many pounds of fertilizer will she use all together? ** Which would be a total of 132+12=<<132+12=144>>144 pounds of fertilizer
## Step 5: #### 144

## Step 1: How many birds are left in the beginning? ** There are 5 birds left on the branch.
## Step 2: How many birds are left after 1 flies away? ** If 1 more bird flies away, there will be 5-1 = <<5-1=4>>4 birds.
## Step 3: How many birds are left on the branch? ** So there are 4 birds left on the branch.
## Step 4: #### 4
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{4}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (667-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on a yoyo and a whistle? ** First, we must find out how much she spent on the yoyo and the whistle. So we add 48 + 28 = <<48+28=76>>76
## Step 2: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on the 4 toys? ** Next, we find out how much more was spent on each of the other 4 toys. So we take our total of money and subtract it from her cost of yoyos and whistles. 96 - 76 = <<96-76=20>>20
## Step 3: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on the 4 toys? ** So we muliply 20 by 4 to find the final total of money spent. $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80
## Step 4: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend in all for the 4 toys? ** Therefore, the final total of money spent on the four yoyos is $80
## Step 5: #### 80
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{80}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (706-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many legs have 9 bees? ** a bee has 6 legs or 7, we must decide which for this problem to be true - 6 only has 2*7 = 14 legs, which means there is a chance that a bee has 7 legs but no proof. On the other hand, the amount of legs that a bee has if 7 is 7*2=14 but that's only half of the bees so the other half, 6 bees, must have 7 legs as well because you can't split bees. so there is 3 bees with 6 and 6 bees with 7 legs.
## Step 2: How many legs do 9 bees have? ** So the total legs of 9 bees are 7*6 + 7*5 = 42 legs.

Answer (713-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many students did buddy meet during recess? ** The total number of students buddy met during recess is 42+11+17=<<42+11+17=70>>70
## Step 2: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** So we can divide the total number of students by 3: 70/3=<<70/3=23.333>>23.333
## Step 3: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** With the lowest whole number being 23 we can multiply by 2 and it is still 46, which is 6 less than 52 and we can find the answer by subtracting 46 by 50 which we can subtract by 10 to get 20 then we can subtract 17, after that we can subtract 11, and finally we can subtract 42. This leaves us with 20-17=<<20-17=3, 3-11=3-11=-8, -8-42=-50>>6 more students than 50.
## Step 4: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** If you want to try to find this answer quickly, you can start by subtracting 50 by 46 and you will get 4 less than 4 that is 6.
## Step 5: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** Then adding 2 to 4 leaves us with 10 more than 10 which is still not 6  then we can start subtracting 5, then we can subtract 2 from that so you will get to 6 but that is not what we are looking for then you can start by subtracting 2 instead and you will have a positive which gives you that number then you can subtract 5 then you can have 4 but that is not 6 but then we can start by subtracting 4 instead and we get a number and then we can add 4 to the number and we get a number and then we can subtract 6 and we get to the answer which is **6.**
## Step 6: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{6}$.

Answer (717-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many males have they served? ** The number of males is the total number of people they served minus the number of females, so the total number of males = 156 people.
## Step 2: How many males have they served? ** The number of males is the total number of people they served minus the number of females, so males = Total people served - Total females = 156 people.
## Step 3: How many males have they served? ** The total number of males =156 /Total adults+children=399 people (Total adults+children = 399) = 156 /399 men.
## Step 4: How many males have they served? ** The total number of males =156 /399 = men.
## Step 5: How many males have they served? ** The number of males = men.
## Step 6: How many males have they served? ** The total number of males = 156/399 = men.
## Step 7: How many males have they served? ** The number of males = men.
## Step 8: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = Total people served - Total males = 399 - men.
## Step 9: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = 399 - Total 156/399 men = Total people served - Total males = 399 - men.
## Step 10: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females =399-men=243 women.
## Step 11: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females =399-156/399 men = 243 women.
## Step 12: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = 399 - Total 156/399 men = Total people served - Total males =399- men.
## Step 13: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = 399 - men = 242 males/399 women
## Step 14: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females =399-156/399 men = 243 women.
## Step 15: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = 399 - Total 156/399 men = 399 - men = women.
## Step 16: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = 399- men = 399-156 /399 = women.
## Step 17: If 156 of all people have served are male how many are female? ** So the number of females = women.

## Step 2: How many apples did Billie find? ** Since there were only 8 apples left for Billie, Billie must have found 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 more apples
## Step 3: How many apples did Billie find? ** So Matthew and Billie found a total of 2 apples, meaning Billie must have found 2 apple(s).

Answer (800-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many cans does Haley put in each bag? ** If she put 14 cans in 3 bags, then she put 14/3=<<14/3=4.666>>4.666 cans in each bag
## Step 2: How many cans did Haley put? ** She put 4 * 4.6666=<<4*4.6666=18.666>>18.666 cans in 4 bags
## Step 3: How many cans does Haley have left? ** Haley had 10 - 18.666 = -<<10-18.666=-8.666>>-8.666 cans
## Step 4: How many cans does Haley have left? ** Since you can't have negative cans then -8.666 cans will be approximated to 9 cans as there is no exact answer
## Step 5: #### -9
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{-9}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (867-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on a yoyo and a whistle? ** First, we must find out how much she spent on the yoyo and the whistle. So we add 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90
## Step 2: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on the 4 toys? ** Next, we find out how much more was spent on each of the other 4 toys. So we take our total of money and subtract it from her cost of yoyos and whistles. 96 - 90 = <<96-90=6>>6
## Step 3: How much did Mrs. Hilt spend on the 4 toys? ** So we muliply 12 (number of toys) by 6 and get 12 * 6 = <<12*6=72>>72 dollars that will buy all the other toys
## Step 4: How much did she spend in all for the 4 toys? ** Now we add her cost of yoyos and whistles to the cost of toys, 90 + 72 = <<90+72=162>>162 dollars
## Step 5: How much did she spend in all for the 4 toys? ** So she spent 162 dollars all for yoyos and whistles,
## Step 6: How much did she spend in all for the 4 toys? ** Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{162}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

Answer (874-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How much money did Mrs. Hilt have left? ** Since she had 17 cents, and she spent 22, she must have had -5 cents left.
## Step 2: <none> ** -5 cents is the answer.
## Step 3: <none> ** Since there is only 1 step for this problem, there is nothing else to add.
## Step 4: <none> ** Since -5 is a negative value, it is not in cents, but since the question asked for cents, so we can multiply by -1 and it will still be -5, but we write it as 5 cents left. However, this would be the opposite of the truth.

## Step 1: How many fifth-grade students did buddy meet? ** The total number of students from fifth grade students who met buddy during recess is 20+32 = <<20+32=52>>52.
## Step 2: How many students did buddy meet during recess? ** So the total number of students buddy met during recess is 52+16+20= <<52+16+20=88>>88
## Step 3: How many more students did buddy meet during recess? ** This means that buddy met 88-32 = <<88-32=56>>56 more students during recess than the number of students in the fifth grade.

Answer (924-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many factories have been checked? ** The second group checked 138 + 104 = <<138+104=242>>242 factories.
## Step 2: How many factories remain unchecked? ** So 507 - 242 = <<507-242=265>>265 remain uncheked.
## Step 3: #### 265
Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{265}$.<|eot_id|><|end-of-response|>

## Step 5: How many books were on the shelves? ** The answer are books on 152 shelves=4.56*102 books on shelves.
## Step 6: How many books were on the shelves? ** 1 book was on shelves, or so we can say = 1 book
## Step 7: How many books were on the shelves? ** So 4560 books on shelves are actually 4560 books on shelves books.
## Step 8: How many books were on the shelves? ** But we simplified the fraction 4560/30 and it was 152 books on shelves.
## Step 9: How many books were on the shelves? ** So now we have 4560/152 books on shelves = 30 books on book/1 book shelf.
## Step 10: How many books were on the shelves? ** Hence 152 boxes are actual boxes = 1 box.
## Step 11: How many books were on the shelves? ** We don't have to tell the number of actual book selves in the boxes. 1 book = 30 so 152*30 is actually 1530 boxes which is obviously books.1 books on shelves.
## Step 12: How many books were on the shelves? ** 152 book shelves would have =30+30+30 book shelves. or 152 books= 1 book.
## Step 13: How many books were on the shelves? ** If you divide both sides by 30, you will get
## Step 14: How many books were on the shelves? ** Hence 4560 books
## Step 15: How many books were on the shelves? ** So 152 books on shelves
## Step 16: How many books were on the shelves? ** But we can convert these to books by saying 1 book = 1 book. In which case 1 books on shelves = 10.
## Step 17: How many books were on the shelves? ** 30 times more which is equal to 30 times 10 so =300 books.
## Step 18: How many books were on the shelves? ** The result is 152 books on shelves which simplifies to 4560 books on book shelves.
## Step 19: How many books were on the shelves? ** And 4560 books /30 books on shelves = 152 books on shelves /1.
## Step 20: How many books were on the shelves? ** Which is obviously 4560/30= 152, and there are 4560/152= 30 books on shelves
## Step 21: How many books were on the shelves? ** Simplifying 4560 books = 4560 books
## Step 22: How many books were on the shelves? ** Hence 4560 books = 30 books.
## Step 23: How many books were on the shelves? ** And since there are 152 book selves so many total books= total number of books
## Step 24: How many books were on the shelves? ** And divide this by how many book selves, or 152.
## Step 25: How many books were on the shelves? ** To get 1 books in each shelf * 4560/30 books on shelves so each box has =152=30 books.
## Step 26: How many books were on the shelves? ** The result is = total books = 152 books.
## Step 27: How many books were on the shelves? ** We know this, but if we use actual books on the shelves to calculate * actual books. So many books are in each book = 4560 in 4560/30 so 152 shelves * 30= 4560 books in 152 shelves books.
## Step 28: How many books were on the shelves? ** However we know that 4560/30 =152 books.
## Step 29: How many books were on the shelves? ** Which means 30 books/book shelf x 152 shelve for 4560 books or that 4560 books= 152 books
## Step 30: How many books were on the shelves? ** Therefore, 30 books/book * 152 shelves = 4560 books / book
## Step 31: How many books were on the shelves? ** Hence 4560/152 =30.
## Step 32: How many books were on the shelves? ** Simplifying this we get 30 books<|end-of-response|>

## Step 1: How many days have passed? ** First find out how many days the two have been reading, 27 pages/day - 19 pages/day = <<27-19=8>>8 more pages
## Step 2: How many more pages did Brad read than Greg? ** Then divide the difference in the number of pages they read per day by the difference in their reading speed, 8 pages / 8 pages/day = <<8/8=1>>1 day
## Step 3: How many more pages did Brad read than Greg? ** The final answer is 1*19 = <<1*19=19>>19 pages

Answer (962-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many more pencils does Mrs. Riley need? ** If there are 56 students and she needs 38 pencils for this many students, we need to find the number of pencils that each student gets.
## Step 2: How many students get pencils? ** If the number of pencils is 38 and the number of students is 56, each student gets 38/56 = <<38/56=0.68>>0.68 pencils.
## Step 3: How many pencils does Mrs. Riley need? ** Since there are 56 students, there are 56 * 0.68 = 38.048 pencils needed in total. But because she can only get a whole pencil, she needs to round up to the next whole number, 38+1 = <<38+1=39>>39 pencils.
## Step 4: How many more pencils does Mrs. Riley need? ** She already has 38 pencils, which is 1 less than the total of 39 pencils she needs. Therefore, she needs 39 - 38 = <<39-38=1>>1 more pencil.

## Step 1: How much money did Haley get from events? ** First add the money Haley had with the money she got from events to find the total money: $4 + $26 = $<<4+26=30>>30
## Step 2: What is the difference between the total and the amount before Haley got money? ** Then subtract the amount before Haley got money from the total money to find the difference. Make sure to use the number only with money not the total, since that money has been counted: $30 - $4 = $<<30-4=26>>26
## Step 3: #### 26

Answer (1000-1/1038): <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

## Step 1: How many cans did Haley put in each bag? ** If she put 9 cans in 3 bags, then she put 9/3=<<9/3=3>>3 cans in each bag.
## Step 2: How many cans is there in the 8 bags? ** This means that 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 cans are left uncollected. These will be put into 4 or 8 bags, not 3, and if Haley put her cans into 8 bags she would have 8/7=1.14 which is not an integer. But if they are distributed into 4 bags, that will give 4/3=1.33 which is also not an integer, however 7/3=2,3 and if 0.3 is given to one bag that would have 2,3+0,3 =2,6 in total.
## Step 3: How many cans are in the 1 bag? ** So that leaves 2.6-2=0.6 cans distributed unevenly in 2-1=1 bag.
## Step 4: #### 0

## Step 1: How many pounds of fertilizer did the florist use in 10 days? ** She used a total of 3 pounds of fertilizer per day for 10 days, so she used 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 pounds of fertilizer
## Step 2: How many pounds of fertilizer did the florist use on the final day? ** On the final day, she used 5 pounds plus her normal amount of 3 pounds, so that is 5+3 = <<5+3=8>>8 pounds of fertilizer.
## Step 3: How many pounds of fertilizer will the florist use altogether? ** Together, the florist used 30 pounds for 10 days and 8 pounds for the final day, so she used a total of 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 pounds of fertilizer
